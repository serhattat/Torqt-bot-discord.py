# Torqt bot
 
Hey there, fellow developers and Discord enthusiasts! ðŸ¤–  I am thrilled to share with you my very first Discord bot, which has been an exciting journey for me into the world of Python programming and the Discord.py. As a newcomer to both Python and bot development, this project has been a fantastic learning experiencea and a whole lot of debugging moments! ðŸ˜„. Bot is designed to bring a touch of fun and functionality to your Discord server. But it includes very personal jokes :).

I couldn't have done this without the incredible support of the open-source community, various tutorials. If you decide to use my bot in your server, please feel free to provide feedback, report any issues you encounter, or even contribute to its development. I'd love to collaborate and learn from experienced developers to make this bot even better. You can find the source code for this bot on my GitHub repository. I hope my code might be helpful to other beginners like me who are curious to dive into Discord bot development using Python.  Thank you for taking the time to check out my first Discord bot. I'm excited to see how it evolves and grows with the help of the community. Happy coding and bot building! ðŸš€

Warmest regards, 
       Wyverian
